# thumbfinder
Basic Javascript tool for piecing together URLs of Youtube thumbnails.

Feel free to lift whatever from this, I went in and added comments with the intent of people even newer to this than me being able to see how everything works.  Or you can see it on my site [here](https://orangecarnation.neocities.org/thumbfinder).
